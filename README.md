Here's a polished and detailed README for your Blood Link – Donation Management System project:

🩸 Blood Link – Donation Management System
Blood Link is a role-based web application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). It streamlines the process of blood donation and inventory management, enabling donors to submit their details and hospitals to manage, track, and monitor blood inventory in real-time.

🚀 Features
🧑‍⚕️ Role-based Access:

Donors can register, log in, and submit available blood type and quantity.

Hospitals can access dashboards to view donations, update inventory status, and request specific blood types.

📦 Real-time Inventory Tracking:
Hospitals can view and update blood inventory in real-time, ensuring better coordination and timely access to life-saving resources.

🔒 Authentication & Authorization:
Secure login and access control implemented using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) and role-based routing.

📱 Responsive Design:
Built with React and CSS to ensure the app works well on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
